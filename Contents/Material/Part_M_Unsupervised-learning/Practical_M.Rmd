1. **Reproduce the data from slide 18 twice, but now instead of $\pm 1.5$ use an adjustment of $\pm .5$ and $\pm 2.5$, respectively**

---

2. **Add a column to the data sets that indicates a `Train` (25%) and a `Test` (75%) part.**

---

3. **Fit the `K-NN` model to both data sets. Use `k = 3`.**

---

4. **What is the percentage of correct predictions for each model?**

---

5. **Plot the false and correct predictions for both models.**

---

6. **Write a function that determines the optimum `k` with respect to classification error. Have the function return the following:**

- The optimum `k` (i.e. the lowest `k` with the most correct predictions)
- The proportion correctly predicted for optimum `k`
- A data frame with the proportion correct for every `k`


---

7. **Execute your function twice: once for the data set based on the `.5` adjustment and once for the data set based on the `2.5` adjustment. Does the previously used `k=3` yield the optimal classification prediction?**
