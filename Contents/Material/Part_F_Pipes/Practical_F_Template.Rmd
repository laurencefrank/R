#### Exercises

The following packages are required for this practical:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(mice)
```
and if you'd like the same results as I have obtained, you can fix the random seed
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```

1. **Use a pipe to do the following:**

- draw 1000 values from a normal distribution with `mean = 5` and `sd = 1` - $N(5, 1)$, 
- create a matrix where the first 500 values are the first column and the second 500 values are the second column **
- make a scatterplot of these two columns
```{r}


```

2. **Use a pipe to calculate the correlation matrix on the `anscombe` data set**

```{r}

```

---

3. **Now use a pipe to calculate the correlation for the pair (`x4`, `y4`) on the `anscombe` data set**

Using the standard `%>%` pipe:
```{r}
# Type your code here
```
Alternatively, we can use the `%$%` pipe from package `magrittr` to make this process much more efficient.
```{r}
# Type your code here
```

4. **Use a pipe to calculate the correlation between `hgt` and `wgt` in the `boys` data set from package `mice`.**

Because `boys` has missings values for almost all variables, we must first select `wgt` and `hgt` and then omit the rows that have missing values, before we can calculate the correlation. Write the code with base R, with the `%>%` pipe and the `%$%` pipe.

```{r}
# Type your code here
```

---

5. **In the `boys` data set, `hgt` is recorded in centimeters. Use a pipe to transform `hgt` in the `boys` dataset to height in meters and verify the transformation** (Hint: use a combination of the standard `%>%` pipe and the `%$%` pipe)
```{r}
# Type your code here
```

---

6. **Use a pipe to plot the pair (`hgt`, `wgt`) two times: once for `hgt` in meters and once for `hgt` in centimeters. Make the points in the 'centimeter' plot `red` and in the 'meter' plot `blue`. **

This is best done with the `%T>%` pipe. Add the correct pipe types in the code below.
```{r eval=FALSE}
boys 
  subset(select = c(hgt, wgt)) 
  plot(col = "red", main = "Height in centimeters") 
  transform(hgt = hgt / 100) 
  plot(col = "blue", main = "Height in meters")
```

The `%T>%` pipe is very useful, because it creates a literal `T` junction in the pipe. It is perhaps most informative to graphically represent the above pipe as follows:

![](flow_t_pipe.png)

We can see that there is indeed a literal T-junction. Naturally, we can expand this process with more `%T>%` pipes. However, once a pipe gets too long or too complicated, it is perhaps more useful to cut the piped problem into smaller, managable pieces.
