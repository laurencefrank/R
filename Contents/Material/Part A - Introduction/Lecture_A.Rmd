Some guidelines

1. If you have a question, you may always interrupt me 
2. We will introduce frequent question breaks

## 2. Learn statistical programming

What is statistical programming?

Broadly speaking, computer programming differs from statistical programming in the following way:

* **Computer programming** is more focused on software development.

* **Statistical programming** is more focused on data analysis and the communication of the results.

# What is R?

## Software

## The origin of R
- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and for graphics

- GNU project (100% free software)

- Managed by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.

- Community-driven

- Based on the object-oriented language S (1975)

# What is `RStudio`?

## `RStudio`
- Aggregates all convenient information and procedures into one single place
- Allows you to work in projects
- Manages your code with highlighting
- Gives extra functionality (Shiny, knitr, markdown, LaTeX)
- Allows for integration with version control routines, such as Git.

# How does R work?

## Objects and elements
- R works with objects that consist of elements. The smallest elements are numbers and characters.

    - These elements are assigned to objects. 
    - A set of objects can be used to perform calculations
    - Calculations can be presented as functions
    - Functions are used to perform calculations and return new objects, containing calculated (or estimated) elements. 

## The help
- Everything that is published on the Comprehensive `R` Archive Network (CRAN) and is aimed at `R` users, must be accompanied by a help file. 
- If you know the name of the function that performs an operation, e.g. `anova()`, then you just type `?anova` or `help(anova)` in the console. 
- If you do not know the name of the function: type `??` followed by your search criterion. For example `??anova` returns a list of all help pages that contain the word 'anova'

- Alternatively, the internet will tell you almost everything you'd like to know and sites such as http://www.stackoverflow.com and http://www.stackexchange.com, as well as `Google` can be of tremendous help. 
    - If you google `R` related issues; use 'R:' as a prefix in your search term
    
## Assigning elements to objects
Assigning things in R is very straightforward: you just use `<-`

For example, if you assign the value `100` (an element) to object `a`, you would type:

```{r}
a <- 100

```

Calling things in R is also very straightforward: 

  - you just type the name you have given to the object

For example, we assigned the value `100` to object `a`. To call object `a`, we would type

```{r}
a
```

## Writing code

This is why we use `RStudio`.

# Organise your work in `RStudio`

## Use `RStudio Projects`

Every time you start a new data analysis project, create a new `RStudio Project`. 

**Because you want your project to work:**

* not only now, but also in a few years;
* when the folder and file paths have changed;
* when collaborators want to run your code on their computer.

`RStudio Projects` create a convention that guarantees that the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work”:

* all code and outputs are stored in one set location;
* relative file paths are created;
* a clean R environment is created every time you open it.

## Example data analysis project with `RStudio project`

Every time you want to work on this project: open the project by clicking the `.Rproj` file.
