# "feel like a god at your own computer"

## What is it?

With Monte Carlo methods we can compute expectations: what do we expect to happen to a particular sample quantity (such as the mean or a p-value) upon repeated sampling?

It builds upon the principles of inferential statistics and needs:

- A large set of numbers (e.g. an infinite population) or a theoretical distribution
- A way to sample randomly from that large set
  
It works by repetitively sampling from a population while varying the input, but keeping the method consistent.

## Why do it?

- evaluate how a statistical method performs in different situations
- calculate the power of a particular test based on some (violation of) assumptions
- estimate the probability of a complex event by simulating that event

# Some probability intuition

## Uncertainty, estimation, repeated sampling

- John travels to and from work by train every day: 
    - In the past 10 years his train has been delayed 12 times
    - $P(\text{delay}) = \frac{12}{2\times3650} \approx .0016$

- Bill travels to and from work by train every week: 
    - In the past year his train has been delayed 50 times
    - $P(\text{delay}) = \frac{50}{2\times52} \approx .481$
  
- Claire travels by train very occasionally
    - Out of the last 3 trips, two trips were delayed
    - $P(\text{delay}) = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.667$


Who should be most confident about their estimate of delay probability?

## Law of large numbers

### Bernouilli's Theorem (1713):
In repeated `independent` experiments 

1. with the same `true` probability $p$ of a particular outcome in each experiment
2. when repeated over a large number of times
3. the average over the results for all these repetitions
4. will converge to the `true` probability $p$

So if we replicate the same procedure an infinite number of times, the difference between our estimate and the true value would be zero.

The experiments **must be independent**, i.e., the event probability in one trial does not depend on other trials.

# Let's throw some dice.

## Law of large numbers
```{r cache=TRUE}
set.seed(123)
x <- sample(1:6, 10, prob = rep(1/6, 6), replace = TRUE)
prop.table(table(x))
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
x <- sample(1:6, 100, prob = rep(1/6, 6), replace = TRUE)
prop.table(table(x))
```

## More samples!
```{r cache=TRUE}
x <- sample(1:6, 10000, prob = rep(1/6, 6), replace = TRUE)
prop.table(table(x))
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
x <- sample(1:6, 1000000, prob = rep(1/6, 6), replace = TRUE)
prop.table(table(x))
```

## Estimating the probability of an event

### What is the probability of getting 123 in a row?
```{r}
charx <- paste(x, collapse = "")

estprob  <- str_count(charx, "123") / 1e6
trueprob <- (1/6)^3

cat(estprob,"\n", trueprob, sep = "")
```

# Monte Carlo simulation

## Throwing 100000 dice 100 times

```{r cache=TRUE}
# Initialise results object
result <- list() 

# repeat K times
for (i in 1:100) { 
  
  # generate a dataset of interest
  dataset <- sample(1:6, 100000, prob = rep(1/6, 6), replace = TRUE)
  
  # optional: perform your method on this dataset
  
  # Save the values you are interested in 
  result[[i]] <- dataset
  
} 

# Aggregate your results
probs <- sapply(result, function(x) prop.table(table(x)))

# Display output
rowMeans(probs)
```

## Unfair dice
```{r cache=TRUE}
result <- list()
for (i in 1:1000) { 
  result[[i]] <- sample(1:6, 
                        size = 1000, 
                        prob = c(.01, .04, .1, .15, .2, .5),
                        replace = TRUE)
} # 1000 trials
probs <- sapply(result, function(x) prop.table(table(x)))
rowMeans(probs)
```

# Power calculation through simulation

## Power simulations

### Power
The probability of detecting an effect if there is in fact a true effect.

### What affects power?
- Larger true effect means larger power (easier to detect the effect)
- Larger sample size means larger power (less uncertainty, smaller standard errors)
- Some methods are more powerful than others

## Example power simulation

### Research question
What happens to the power of an independent-samples t-test if we measure on a 5-point scale instead of a continuous outcome?

## Measuring on 5-point scale

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
cuts <- c(-Inf, -1.2, -0.4, 0.4, 1.2, Inf)

curve(dnorm, from = -3, to = 3)
abline(v = cuts)
```

## Let's perform a t-test!
```{r}
set.seed(123)

effect_size <- 0.7
treatment   <- rnorm(24, mean = effect_size)
control     <- rnorm(24, mean = 0)

treatCut <- as.numeric(cut(treatment, cuts))
contrCut <- as.numeric(cut(control,  cuts))

t.test(treatment, control)$p.value
t.test(treatCut, contrCut)$p.value
```

How confident are we in this result?

## Monte carlo simulation

```{r simsim, cache=TRUE}
# Initialise results object
result <- matrix(FALSE, nrow = 100000, ncol = 2) 

for (i in 1:100000) { 
  # generate a dataset of interest
  treatment <- rnorm(24, .7)
  control   <- rnorm(24)
  treatCut <- as.numeric(cut(treatment, cuts))
  contrCut <- as.numeric(cut(control,  cuts))
  
  # perform your method on this dataset
  treatp <- t.test(treatment, control)$p.value
  contrp <- t.test(treatCut, contrCut)$p.value
  
  # Save the values you are interested in 
  result[i,1] <- treatp < 0.05
  result[i,2] <- contrp < 0.05
} 

colMeans(result)
```


## Conclusions

- Monte Carlo simulations can estimate difficult-to-calculate probabilities
- iterations yield less bias (law of large numbers)
- Monte Carlo simulations can be used to test the statistical properties of methodologies
    - At what sample size does my method fail?
    - How much of a violation of sphericity is allowed in an ANOVA?
    - What is the power of a nonparametric vs. a parametric test?
    - How biased is my estimation procedure?
    - What is the effect on power if I do this sub-optimal thing?
